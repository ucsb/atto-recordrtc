# atto-recordrtc
A patch that addresses having multiple moodle atto editors with the recordrtc plugin on a single page.  When you have multiple moodle atto recordrtc plugins on a single page an error occurs where many of the recordrtc plugins will not work.

This patch was programmed on a stable release of MOODLE35, but I think this patch will also work on MOODLE38+, but you would have to install the various npm packages and run grunt shifter.
